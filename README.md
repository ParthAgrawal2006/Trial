Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots A real-time pricing engine for 14 lots using custom models that adjust rates based on occupancy, traffic, and demand ‚Äî built with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
# üöó Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

A Capstone Project for **Summer Analytics 2025**  
Hosted by: *Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway*

## üìå Project Overview

Urban parking resources are limited and high in demand. Static pricing strategies lead to underutilized or overcrowded parking spaces. This project aims to design and simulate a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** that adjusts parking rates based on:

- **Occupancy levels**
- **Traffic conditions**
- **Queue lengths**
- **Special event days**
- **Vehicle types**
- **Nearby competitor pricing**

We developed **three pricing models** from scratch and simulated their impact on pricing across **14 parking lots** using historical time-series data.  
The models are implemented entirely with core Python tools and visualized using `matplotlib`.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Workflow
1. Data Input
‚Ä¢	The dataset contains occupancy data for 14 parking spaces sampled 18 times daily over 73 days.
‚Ä¢	Each record includes:
o	Occupancy count and lot capacity
o	Queue length
o	Vehicle type
o	Special event indicator
o	Traffic congestion level
o	GPS coordinates for proximity modeling
2. Feature Engineering
‚Ä¢	Encoded categorical variables:
o	Traffic ‚Üí (low=0, medium=1, high=2)
o	Vehicle type ‚Üí weight values (bike=0.8, car=1.0, truck=1.2)
‚Ä¢	Normalized key features like occupancy ratio and demand
3. Model Implementations
‚úÖ Model 1: Linear Occupancy-Based Pricing
python
CopyEdit
Price_t+1 = Price_t + Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
‚úÖ Model 2: Demand Function
A weighted linear demand function:
python
CopyEdit
Demand = Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity) + Œ≤ * QueueLength - Œ≥ * Traffic + Œ¥ * IsSpecialDay + Œµ * VehicleWeight
Price = BasePrice √ó (1 + Œª √ó NormalizedDemand)
‚úÖ Model 3: Competitive Pricing
‚Ä¢	Uses simulated competitor pricing
‚Ä¢	Adjusts prices up or down depending on:
o	Nearby lot prices
o	Own occupancy
o	Opportunity to undercut or price higher
4. Visualization
‚Ä¢	All 3 models are plotted for each parking lot
‚Ä¢	Each lot has its own subplot with real-time price line graphs
